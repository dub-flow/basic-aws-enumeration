# S3

Note: All commands may be run with and withouth `--no-sign-request`

- `aws s3 ls <bucket_name> --no-sign-request` (unauthenticated access)
- `aws s3 ls <bucket_name> --profile <some-profile>` (check if any authenticated user can access - even when logged into another AWS instance then where the bucket is hosted)
- `aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket>` (list bucket ACL)
- `aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket>` (list bucket policy)
- `aws s3api get-object-acl --bucket <bucket> --key <file-to-check>` (check the object policy of a particular file in the bucket)
- `aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket <bucket> --no-sign-request` (check the objects' versions)
    - If an objecte has `IsLatest` set to `false`, it means there are multiple versions and we can potentially access other versions of the file
    - We can dump all versions by running `./s3BucketVersionDumper.sh` (https://github.com/cloudbreach/CloudBreach_AWSScripts/blob/master/s3BucketVersionDumper.sh)
