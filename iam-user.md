- `aws sts get-caller-identity` (whoami?) -> or, alternatively, `iam get-user`
- `aws iam list-groups-for-user` (what groups am I a part of?)
- `aws iam list-group-policies` (what policies are attached to those groups?)
- `aws iam get-policy` (what statements compose these policies?) -> `get-policy` only looks for managed policies
- `aws iam get-policy-version` (what statements compose these policies?)
- `aws iam list-user-policies` (what are the inline policies for this user?)
- `aws iam get-user-policy` (what statements compose these policies?) -> `get-user-policy` looks for inline policies 
- `aws iam list-attached-user-policies` (what policies are attached to this user?)
    - We run `iam get-policy` again to access the version of the policy
    - Last, we run `iam get-policy-version` to get access to the statements
